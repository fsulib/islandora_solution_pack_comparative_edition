# How Indexing Works

The primary feature of the Islandora Comparative Edition Solution Pack is the ability to compare sentences across several witnesses, and these sentences are collated together into master index files during "the indexing process". This process is triggered every time a new witness is ingested or deleted, as well as any time a *PINDEX datastream on a page object is replaced. To see how indexing works in the code, see the [IslandoraComparativeEditionObject::generateDisplayMindex()](https://github.com/fsulib/islandora_solution_pack_comparative_edition/blob/master/includes/classes.inc#L111-L172) and [IslandoraComparativeEditionObject::generateDisplayMindex()](https://github.com/fsulib/islandora_solution_pack_comparative_edition/blob/master/includes/classes.inc#L111-L172) function which kicks off the indexing process. If CollateX isn't available, [IslandoraComparativeEditionObject::formatSentenceUnaligned](https://github.com/fsulib/islandora_solution_pack_comparative_edition/blob/master/includes/classes.inc#L10-L23) is used. If CollateX is enabled, [IslandoraComparativeEditionObject::formatSentenceAligned](https://github.com/fsulib/islandora_solution_pack_comparative_edition/blob/master/includes/classes.inc#L25-L109) is used which is a much more complicated process compared to IslandoraComparativeEditionObject::formatSentenceUnaligned.
